This package contains a set of nodes to interact with IBM Connections.

## List of nodes

This package will add 6 new nodes into your node-red palette : 

- The profile OUT node
- The embedded experience node
- The GetProfiles node
- The GetActivities node
- The Udate Activity node
- The CreateActivity node
